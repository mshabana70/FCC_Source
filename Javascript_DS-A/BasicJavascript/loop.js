// JAVASCRIPT LOOPS

/*
    In programming, when it comes to tasks that 
    require certain commands or blocks of code to be
    run continously, loops are the best for that. Depending
    on if you need to run while a condition is met, or if you need
    a set amount of iterations, JavaScript has you covered with
    different loops to depending on what you need.
